# Docker
## Introduction
- [Installation](installation/README.md)
- [Concepts](concepts/README.md)
- [Image Concepts](concepts/image.md)

### Terminology
- image: a lightweight executable package that includes everything needed to run a piece of software, including the code, a runtime, libraries, environment variables, and config files.
  - *image name* = *repository* + *tag*
- container: a runtime instance of an image -- what the image becomes in memory when actually executed. It runs completely isolated from the host environment by default, only accessing host files and ports if configured to do so.
- registry: image store
