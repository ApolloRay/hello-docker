# Docker
## Terminology
- image: a lightweight, stand-alone, executable package that includes everything needed to run a piece of software, including the code, a runtime, libraries, environment variables, and config files.
- container: a runtime instance of an image -- what the image becomes in memory when actually executed. It runs completely isolated from the host environment by default, only accessing host files and ports if configured to do so.
- service: different pieces of an application are called services.
- stack:a stack is a group of interrelated services that share dependencies, and can be orchestrated and scaled together.
